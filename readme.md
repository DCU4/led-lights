# LED LIGHTS

Using Node.js and websockets, this server lives on my raspberry pi and powers a 32 led light strip. The led lights themselves are controlled with python through a number of scripts. These mainly rely on the Adafruit_WS2801 module and some code that I found [here](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/how-to-control-a-raspberry-pi-ws2801-rgb-led-strip/).
